# processName is used to capture the load statistics in the audit table.
# Partitioning is based on the this name in the audit table.
spark.DataIngestion.processName:dmactDataExtract


# LoadType defines the frequency of load and type.
# TL-Truncate and Load, DI,MI,WI- Daily, Monthly & Weekly incremental loads respctivley, CI- Continous Ingestion Load
spark.DataIngestion.loadType:DI


# Restartabilty Indicator is used to reload the table that are failed to write to S3 or a count mismatch event.
# When set to Y - EDF will fetch all the failed table for the day and reload the respective partitions.
spark.DataIngestion.restartabilityInd:N


# Restartabilty level along with the restartability Indicator, will specify the restarabilty level between set of tables or entire batch.
# When set to table - EDF will reload the failed table from the previous batches for the day.
# When set to batch - EDF will skip the table that are successfully loaded in the last batch and load the rest of the tables in a batch.
spark.DataIngestion.restartabilityLevel:table


# restartTableIdentifier sets the loadStatus that needs to be considered for the restart Mode.
# by Default, this property takes failed status from audit table. For any custom status, modify the below parameter accordingly for reloading the previously failed JObs.
# This setting affects only the table level restartability.
spark.DataIngestion.restartTableIdentifier:failedUnknown


# partitionOverwriteMode defined the target partition mode of whether to Overwrite or Append a partition.
# By Default, this property takes static.
# For incremental load that involved staging layer, this needs to be dynamic
spark.DataIngestion.partitionOverwriteMode:dynamic


# batchParallelism defines the degree of asynchronus data load.
# This number defines how many tables are read from database and written to S3 in parallel.
spark.DataIngestion.batchParallelism:8


# ConsiderBatchWindow will be used to switch between the batch window timings vs using max(updatetime) in the hive target table.
spark.DataIngestion.considerBatchWindow:N


# batchEndCutOff along with the loadType - CI, will define the cutt off time for the EDF on a day.
# To end the continous load at 7:00 PM EST, specify 18-59
spark.DataIngestion.batchEndCutOff:19-59


# This parameter is used to define the iteration for harDeleteBatch.
# This when set on CI mode, will start the hardDeleteBatch at this Iteration.

# repl_table specifies how EDF will get the batch window timing  between database replication table vs database sysdate.
# When blank, database system date will be used, otherwise the given repl_table will be queried for the batch window.
spark.DataIngestion.repl_table:


# timeLagInMins along with the batchWindowTiming will determine the batch window end time.
# To limit the batch window timing to current system time minus 2 mins, specify -2.
spark.DataIngestion.timeLagInMins:0


# lookUpFile specifies the typelist joins to be performed before inserting into harmonized layer in S3.
# If no lookup required, provide an empty file with only the header.

# specify an empty file with only the header, if no PII found.

# targetDB will be used to prefix the hive database name.
# uat_lgcy_dmact specifies the database prefix for policy center which is transformed as connect_gwpc_data_processed in reference to the Glue catalog.
